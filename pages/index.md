Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Iâ€™m a Graduate student studying Computer Vision and Robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My technical skills include proficiency in C++, Java and Python, as well as knowledge of DevOps, Agile, and ROS. Over the course of my education, I have developed an affinity for robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and the limitless possibilities in that field. I am currently seeking a full time software engineering position in a similar field.
