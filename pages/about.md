# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a senior Computer Science major studying at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My technical skills include proficiency in C++, Java and Python, as well as knowledge of DevOps, Agile, and ROS. Over the course of my education, I have developed an affinity for robotics and autonomous vehicle systems, and the limitless possibilities in that field. I am currently seeking a software engineering internship in a similar field.

This summer I worked at Amazon.com as a Software Development Engineering Intern in the AWS Sagemaker team, where I was responsible for developing a query engine in the form of a command line interface tool which queries and displays information about AWS region builds and helps in the automation process. During the academic year I’m the President for Autonomous Robotics Vehicles project team, where we build an autonomous robot to compete, and an elected senator of the Engineering Student Government. In my free time I enjoy baking, watching movies, and working out.
