Our overall pipeline is split among two Github Repos and a Python Notebook
1. This contains the code for pre-processing video data: https://github.com/schefferac2020/LipReading
2. This contains the code for the Viseme Prediction Network: https://github.com/ChristianForeman/VPN
3. The notebook for the beam search is here [TODO]
